[![Verify](https://github.com/Tah10n/opencode-harness/actions/workflows/verify.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Tah10n/opencode-harness/actions/workflows/verify.yml)

Reproducible OpenCode orchestration profile.

This repository contains a reusable OpenCode behavior profile:

- primary orchestrator prompts;
- focused subagents;
- global safety rules;
- review and re-review ledger workflow;
- high-assurance quality gates for baseline, behavior contracts, edge/failure
  matrices, verification ladders, and final adversarial audit;
- an executable feedback plane: schema-v2 operational traces, immutable live
  reports, paired baseline/candidate assessment, and explicit decisions;
- trace, budget/termination, and shared subagent result-schema contracts;
- a strict read-only primary review orchestrator for diff and release review;
- recursive-context operating rules;
- static adversarial fixtures for prompt-injection, command-injection,
  secret-bait, and review-only traps;
- controlled memory and self-improvement policy;
- commands such as `learn`, `curate-learning`, `review-diff`, `workflow`, and
  `harness-release-review`;
- deterministic verification for static structure, contract/config scenarios,
  drift, feedback persistence, live manifests, and runtime parser fixtures;
- optional installed runtime permission checks and live A/B evaluation.

Development status: this checkout targets unreleased `0.3.0`. The latest
tagged release is `v0.2.0`, whose package metadata has no `exports` field and
therefore does not expose the feedback API subpaths described below.

It is intentionally separate from plugin capabilities:

- [`opencode-recursive-context`](https://github.com/Tah10n/opencode-recursive-context) provides safe read-only `context_*` tools.
- [`opencode-learning-guard`](https://github.com/Tah10n/opencode-learning-guard) provides bounded `oc_learning_*` write tools.
- `opencode-harness` decides when and how agents should use those tools.

## Usage

Copy or adapt the profile files into an OpenCode configuration:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `opencode.json`
- `agents/`
- `commands/`
- `skills/`
- `docs/`

Keep personal memory entries, machine-specific plugin paths, local automation,
and project-specific workflow facts outside this repository.

Detailed adoption steps live in [docs/adoption.md](docs/adoption.md). The
control matrix lives in [docs/harness-map.md](docs/harness-map.md), and project
readiness guidance lives in [docs/harnessability.md](docs/harnessability.md).
Trace, budget, and subagent handoff contracts live in
[docs/trace-contract.md](docs/trace-contract.md),
[docs/budgets-and-termination.md](docs/budgets-and-termination.md), and
[docs/subagent-result-schema.md](docs/subagent-result-schema.md).

## Adoption

1. Install or configure the capability packages:
   - [`opencode-recursive-context`](https://github.com/Tah10n/opencode-recursive-context)
   - [`opencode-learning-guard`](https://github.com/Tah10n/opencode-learning-guard)
2. Copy or adapt this profile's `AGENTS.md`, `opencode.json`, `agents/`,
   `commands/`, `skills/`, and `docs/` into the target OpenCode configuration.
3. Keep machine-local plugin paths, personal memory entries, and project-specific
   workflow facts out of this template.
4. Run the local verifier:

   ```powershell
   npm run verify
   ```

5. In the live OpenCode configuration, confirm the effective runtime surface:

   ```powershell
   npm run verify:runtime
   ```

   Or run the underlying OpenCode checks manually:

   ```powershell
   opencode debug config
   opencode debug agent orchestrator
   opencode debug agent orchestrator-deep
   opencode debug agent review-orchestrator
   opencode debug agent reviewer
   opencode debug agent improver
   ```

Expected runtime result: the orchestrator and read-only agents expose the
minimal safe `context_*` surface (`context_outline`, `context_files`,
`context_search`, and `context_read`), while `oc_learning_*` write tools are
available only through the bounded self-improvement path. Advanced
recursive-context tools are host opt-ins.

## Local State Boundary

`skills/global-memory/SKILL.md` in this repository is a clean template. It
defines the memory shape and policy, but it should not contain private durable
memory entries.

`.oc_harness/` is a different kind of memory: bounded machine-local operational
evidence for runs and first-party acceptance inputs. Its run store contains
structured events, context receipts, delegated-job records, verification, and
outcomes, with total quotas and consistency-checked finalization. It is ignored
by Git and the OpenCode watcher. Generated live reports
and candidate decisions are likewise ignored under `evals/reports/` and
`evals/decisions/`.

Operational evidence is disposable and must not become durable semantic
memory. Reusable lessons remain gated through `global-memory`/`improver`, while
project-specific facts remain in `WORKFLOW.md` or project-local skills.

## Feedback Plane API And CLI

The API and CLI in this section describe the unreleased `0.3.0` target, not
the tagged `v0.2.0` package.

Node ESM integrations import the public package boundary:

```js
import { createAdapterInstrumentation, createTraceStore } from "opencode-harness/feedback";
```

`opencode-harness/trace-store` is a compatibility export. The trace CLI exposes
run creation, schema-v2 event emission, and inspection:

```sh
npm run trace -- create --json '{"risk":"standard"}'
npm run trace -- emit --run-id <id> --file event.json
npm run trace -- inspect --run-id <id>
```

See [docs/trace-contract.md](docs/trace-contract.md) for lifecycle, privacy,
and schema-v1 read compatibility.

## Verification

Run the local harness checks before copying or publishing template changes:

```powershell
npm run verify
```

The default gate includes an isolated, no-provider copy smoke. Run it directly
when changing adoption contents or package boundaries:

```powershell
npm run verify:adoption-bundle
```

Run the installed-profile runtime sensor after copying the profile into a live
OpenCode configuration:

```powershell
npm run verify:runtime
```

For local private-name checks, keep the marker list outside the repository
and pass it through the environment:

```powershell
$env:HARNESS_FORBIDDEN_MARKERS=$env:HARNESS_PRIVATE_MARKERS
npm run verify
```

After copying the profile into a live OpenCode configuration, also run the
runtime checks documented in `docs/recursive-context-mode.md` and
`docs/memory-and-self-improvement.md`.

The static evaluation scenarios are documented in
[docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md). Compatibility and release guidance
live in [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md) and
[docs/release.md](docs/release.md). Optional live A/B evaluation is documented
in [docs/live-evaluation.md](docs/live-evaluation.md). Static adversarial
fixtures live under [fixtures/adversarial/](fixtures/adversarial/).

`npm run verify` is deterministic repository-side assurance. It does not prove
actual model behaviour, requires no model/network/live adapter, and includes
the infrastructure tracing self-test without an LLM. Keep these layers
separate:

1. `npm run verify` — deterministic repository, feedback-plane, and portable
   adoption-bundle contracts.
2. `npm run verify:runtime` — effective installed permission surface.
3. `npm run eval:live` — actual adapter/model/tool behaviour.
4. `npm run assess:candidate` — policy-backed accepted/rejected/inconclusive
   decision over trusted baseline/candidate evidence.

Capture first-party static evidence with
`npm run evidence:static -- --candidate-id <id>`. Capture installed permission
evidence for that exact source snapshot with
`npm run verify:runtime -- --evidence-profile <id> --subject-evidence <static.json>`.
The runtime producer inventories installed agents with `opencode agent list`,
records each `{name, mode}` and every discovered permission surface, and binds
them to a content attestation. Required modes and exclusive web/learning
permissions are checked across the discovered inventory. Missing or unsupported
inventory or permission data fails closed
or stays explicitly incomplete instead of becoming an implicit deny. Fixture
permission snapshots are parser tests and are not trusted for candidate
acceptance. See
[docs/evaluation.md](docs/evaluation.md) and
[docs/live-evaluation.md](docs/live-evaluation.md).

Static evidence verifies an external materialized snapshot rather than the
mutable source directory. Live report trust requires an intact immutable
JSON/Markdown/marker generation, and candidate decisions bind the canonical
scenario-corpus and repetition-universe fingerprints.
Live adapter traces stay in a bounded in-memory journal and reach
`.oc_harness/` only as a finalized batch after verified process-tree teardown.

## Why this is a harness

Plugins add tools. A harness defines the agent runtime behavior around those
tools: orchestration, safety, delegation, context gathering, review loops, and
verification discipline.

The design is informed by Martin Fowler's
[harness engineering for coding agents](https://martinfowler.com/articles/harness-engineering.html)
framing and by runtime practices from
[DenisSergeevitch/agents-best-practices](https://github.com/DenisSergeevitch/agents-best-practices).
